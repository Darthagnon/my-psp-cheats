# My PSP Cheats
PSP cheats database

## Usage
- Edit the `cheat.db` with [CWCheat Database Editor v2.0](https://www.brewology.com/downloads/download.php?id=7176)
- Use [TempAR v1.63](https://www.brewology.com/downloads/download.php?id=13092) on the PSP, or native PPSSPP emulator functions.
	- I do not recommend [CWCheat](https://www.brewology.com/downloads/download.php?id=10147); the GUI is messy and I had lots of crashing in games on multiple PSP 3000 (6.60 Pro C1-fix3)
	- I don't know what you'd use on PS Vita.
	- I wish PPSSPP supported cheats.db natively, but it does not, and you have to manually copy cheats over into a text window ðŸ˜¥

## Resources

- The original cheats database was included with the CWCheat plugin (or downloaded by the database editor) and I added miscellaneous cheats to it and save multiple versions before I knew anything about versioning, backups, etc.
- [Cheat Device Remastered](http://cheatdeviceremastered.com/), a standalone Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City & Vice City Stories PSP cheat plugin, remade in 2021. Recommended; works on PS Vita, too. [YouTube guide here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGuZ_4T2R_w); see also [GTANativeRes](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/GTANativeRes) (PS Vita native resolution GTA), [RemasteredControls](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/RemasteredControls) (PS Vita dual analog usage for PSP games)
- [FUComplete](https://github.com/FUComplete/Patch/wiki/Enhancements-and-BonusDLC), a "definitive edition" mod of Monster Hunter Freedom Unite / Portable 2nd G, has some new cheats in its wiki
- [60 fps cheats](https://kabutokun.github.io/) for PSP games. I may add these at some point, but not sure, as not all work on original PSP hardware (and the PSP is the only place you'd need the cheats in the DB). 
- [60/30 fps cheat for MGS: Peace Walker](https://old.reddit.com/r/vitahacks/comments/2w5zti/guide_how_to_get_30fps_mgs_peace_walker_on_your/) - confirmed working on my PSP, Peace Walker normally runs at 15-20 fps and feels perfectly playable, if a little like you're playing with a rubber doll. 30fps cheat feels amazing.
- If playing on [PPSSPP Emulator](https://ppsspp.org/), I recommend using the [original PSP fonts](https://cdromance.com/guides/original-psp-fonts-for-ppsspp-for-android-and-pc-download/)

## TODO:
- see if I can find those misc. forums I got some of the Monster Hunter cheats from.

- [Monster Hunter Freedom Unite(MHFU) Cheat Codes PPSSPP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZxDxKmHsAM) YouTube, E Gaming, 15 Oct 2020 (according to this video, PPSSPP can import cheats from cheat.db. I need to confirm this). E Gaming is a good channel; I got a bunch of 3DS Monster Hunter DLC from him.
- Find what cheat plugin is recommended for the PS Vita.
- See also [here](https://forums.ppsspp.org/showthread.php?tid=11123) and need to check why MHFU HUD OFF code doesn't work
